You are in charge of figuring out how the email campaign performed and
were asked the following questions: 1. What percentage of users opened
the email and what percentage clicked on the link within the email? 2.
The VP of marketing thinks that it is stupid to send emails to a random
subset and in a random way. Based on all the information you have about
the emails that were sent, can you build a model to optimize in future
email campaigns to maximize the probability of users clicking on the
link inside the email? 3. By how much do you think your model would
improve click through rate ( defined as \# of users who click on the
link / total users who received the email). How would you test that? 4.
Did you find any interesting pattern on how the email campaign performed
for different segments of users? Explain. \# Input libraries needed

# Input data

``` r
email_data = read.csv('email_table.csv')

Old click through rate = 2% So comparing with randomly selected email
pools, this model would improve click through rate by more than 2 times
sending emails to top 25% users that has highest probability to click
the link that predicted by this model.

More precisely, we can conduct a A/B Test to see whether the prediction
model actually help increase the click through rate.

partialPlot(rf, train_data, user_past_purchases, 1) 
partialPlot(rf, train_data, hour, 1)
partialPlot(rf, train_data, weekday, 1)
partialPlot(rf, train_data, user_country, 1)
partialPlot(rf, train_data, email_version, 1)
partialPlot(rf, train_data, email_text, 1)
```

![](07.-Email-Git_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)<!-- --> From
the partial dependence plot, we can see that: 1. users that have more
purchases in the past, is more likely to click the link, probably
indicating that we need to send emails focusing on the old, loyal
customers. 2. 10 am peaks on the CTR, we might change our sending email
time to 10AM. 3. Email sent at weekday(middle of the week) has higher
CTR compared with weekends! 4. UK and US have significantly higher CTR
compared with other countries, so we can put more priority to these two
countries. 5. Personalized and short email is more attractive to
customers to click.

patten as we saw in random forest partial dependence plot. \# 4. Did you
find any interesting pattern on how the email campaign performed for
different segments of users? Explain.

So there can be segments like: US/UK and ES/FR: US/UK has much higher
CTR through the email campaign Loyal users: Users purchases more than 9
items are very likely to click the link in the email campaign.
